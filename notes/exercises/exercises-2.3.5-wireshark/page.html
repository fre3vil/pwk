<title>Exercises-2.3.5-Wireshark</title>
</head><body>1. 1. Use Wireshark to capture the network activity of Netcat connecting to port 110<br/>
(POP3) and attempting a login.<br/>
2. Read and understand the output. Where is the session three-way handshake?<br/>
Where is the session closed?<br/>
3. Follow the TCP stream to read the login attempt.<br/>
4. Use the display filter to only see the port 110 traffic<br/>
5. Re-run the capture, this time using the capture filter to only collect port 110<br/>
<br/>
1. Run Wireshark with capture filter "host 10.11.10.14 and port 110".<br/>
2. The three-way handshake is in the first three packets before the response saying "POP3 server ready."<br/>
3. Completed.<br/>
4. Use display filter "tcp.port eq 110"<br/>
5. Completed<br/>
