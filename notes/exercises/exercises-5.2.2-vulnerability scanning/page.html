<title>Exercises-5.2.2-Vulnerability Scanning</title>
</head><body>1. Use nmap scripts and OpenVAS to conduct targeted scans (against single hosts)<br/>
against systems in your target network.<br/>
2. Account for the traffic using iptables. How many resources does scanning a<br/>
single host require, in terms of network bandwidth, and time?<br/>
3. Consider the sort of vulnerabilities a scanner will identify. What are the<br/>
limitations of the tool? Why?<br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
nmap -v -p 80 --script all 10.11.1.22<br/>
Didn't find anything except that root is the likely login name.<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
iptables -nv -L<br/>
405 MB for one machine using nmap --script all. That's a lot. Don't use this --script all scan often but instead only for a specific machine machine of interest that you are trying to get even more information about.<br/>
<br/>
3. Vulnerability scanners are limited in that they will produce false positives and will miss some vulnerabilities. It might not be aware of the newest vulnerabilities yet. It will most commonly search for only the most well known vulnerabilities such as Microsoft updates.<br/>
