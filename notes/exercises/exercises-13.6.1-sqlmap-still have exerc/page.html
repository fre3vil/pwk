</head><body>13.6.1 - Exercises<br/>
1. Use the sqlmap crawl option to enumerate the various pages of the vulnerable<br/>
web application and search for SQL injection vulnerabilities.<br/>
2. Use sqlmap to obtain a full dump of the database.<br/>
3. Use sqlmap to obtain an interactive shell.<br/>
4. Use sqlmap in the lab network to gather information on various targets.<br/>
5. Use sqlmap in the lab network to obtain a shell on a target machine. Can you<br/>
exploit the SQL injection manually?<br/>

Do this after the other exercises. This is an actual attack on a lab target. Come back and complete later. Use this forum for reference: https://forums.offensive-security.com/showthread.php?6809-13-6-1-4-Sqlmap-on-the-labs/page2&amp;highlight=tamper<br/>

"For anyone having trouble still finding machines to do this exercise on, do not fret, they exist. I ran the same scan twice and the first time nothing came up, and the second time, it gave a POC for an injection method. I<b>t might not be a machine or port you would immediately think to use it on, so keep looking</b>. Make sure to really dig in to sqlmap and learn the parameters you can use. <b>sqlmap -hh </b>is a good starting point"<br/>

It's a very frustrating exercise and it's certainly out of place: where all previous exercises gave you everything you needed to proceed, in this case the target you're looking for is pretty well hidden. It's not in a place where you'd usually expect it, almost forcing you to tackle the exercise only when you find a relevant target in the labs.<br/>

</span><span style="color: #ff0000">It's not necessarily useless, because it helps you practice your enumeration and to do another SQLi attack... But yeah, frustrating.</span><br/>
