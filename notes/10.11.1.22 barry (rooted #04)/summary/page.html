<title>Summary</title>
</head><body>Searched for exploits primarily in Apache 1.3.23 thinking it was for sure the way in because of how old it was. <br/>
<br/>
Searched for OpenSSL, SSH, other vulnerabilities. Kind of neglected SMB because it wasn't Windows.<br/>
<br/>
Went back to enum4linux and saw Samba 2.2.3. I had been searching in MSF for the other vulnerabilities and ended up trying one for Samba. It worked.<br/>
<br/>
Found 7.pl in exploit-db for the manual exploit.<br/>
<br/>
Lesson: Don't dig too far into other services if they aren't producing a result. Try the others. Also SMB is not limited to Windows.<br/>
